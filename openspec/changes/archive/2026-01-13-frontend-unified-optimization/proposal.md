## Problem Statement

The current frontend architecture suffers from multiple issues:

### Current State Analysis
- **15 flat menus** causing cognitive overload
- **Inconsistent UI/UX** across components
- **Performance bottlenecks** in charting and data handling
- **Limited mobile responsiveness**
- **Mixed JS/TS codebase** with type safety gaps
- **Basic navigation** without domain-driven organization

### Business Impact
- **Poor user experience** for professional traders
- **Development inefficiency** due to architectural debt
- **Scalability limitations** for new features
- **Maintenance challenges** with inconsistent patterns
