## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Runtime Audit Governance
The system SHALL record data-source, database, cache, and runtime-dependency audits as governance artifacts that classify each audited item by runtime status, compatibility duty, and required verification evidence.

#### Scenario: Runtime audit is published
- **WHEN** a data or database runtime audit is completed
- **THEN** the audit output SHALL identify each reviewed item as active, compatibility-retained, redundant, or pending classification
- **AND** it SHALL record the canonical evidence source and the minimum verification used for the judgment
