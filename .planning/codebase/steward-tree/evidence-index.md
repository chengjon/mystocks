# Steward Tree Evidence Index

> **历史文档说明**: 本文件是历史快照、历史方案或历史总结，不代表当前仓库的唯一事实状态。若需确认当前共享规则、执行口径、目录结构或实现状态，请优先以 `architecture/STANDARDS.md`、根目录 `AGENTS.md`、根目录 `CLAUDE.md`、当前代码与最近一次实际验证结果为准。

## Status

- Status: active evidence index
- Prepared at: `2026-05-27T18:06:02+08:00`
- Base HEAD checked: `597f8186092b4ad3d0704326e292c5e4fa075f15`

Boundary note: this index points to evidence artifacts. It does not promote
review input into accepted truth without a matching review, PR, or OpenSpec
state transition.

## Evidence Recording Rules

- Evidence collected from context-mode must be summarized into repo files before
  it becomes durable project evidence.
- GitNexus risk results belong in implementation or authorization reports, not
  only in chat memory.
- GitHub PR state must include PR number, branch, base, and checked timestamp.
- Generated artifact references must include `generated_at`, `git_head` when
  available, `current_head_checked_at_review`, and a stale policy.
- Graphiti entries should record accepted milestone summaries after the repo or
  GitHub artifact exists.
