# Steward Tree Evidence Index

> **历史文档说明**: 本文件是历史快照、历史方案或历史总结，不代表当前仓库的唯一事实状态。若需确认当前共享规则、执行口径、目录结构或实现状态，请优先以 `architecture/STANDARDS.md`、根目录 `AGENTS.md`、根目录 `CLAUDE.md`、当前代码与最近一次实际验证结果为准。

## Status

- Status: active evidence index
- Prepared at: `2026-05-27T15:32:41+08:00`
- Base HEAD checked: `3b8f95945fcb489316ddfaf919835d372122fa5f`

Boundary note: this index points to evidence artifacts. It does not promote
review input into accepted truth without a matching review, PR, or OpenSpec
state transition.

## Primary Evidence Artifacts

| Evidence | Role | Freshness policy |
|---|---|---|
| `.planning/codebase/steward-tree/archive/CODEBASE-MAP-OPENSPEC-TASK-TREE-2026-05-20.full-2026-05-27.md` | Full historical steward snapshot | Historical; refresh current state before using as execution truth |
| `.planning/codebase/CODEBASE-MAP-STEWARD-TREE-RETROSPECTIVE-2026-05-22.md` | Lessons and improvement opportunities | Historical; use as rationale for this split |
| `.planning/codebase/CODEBASE-MAP-STEWARD-TREE-PRACTICE-GUIDE-2026-05-24.md` | Reusable operating model for other projects | Historical; superseded for this repo by `steward-tree/README.md` |
| `.planning/codebase/steward-tree/steward-index.json` | Machine-readable active steward state | Current for this branch; stale if base HEAD or PR state changes |
| `.planning/codebase/steward-tree/current-next-gates.md` | Human-readable active gates | Current for this branch; stale if PR `#331` state changes |

## External State Inputs

| Input | Current state at split | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub PR `#331` | `OPEN`, `MERGEABLE` | Separate G2.178 source implementation lane |
| `origin/wip/root-dirty-20260403` | `3b8f95945fcb489316ddfaf919835d372122fa5f` | Base used for this governance split |
| Root worktree | Dirty/stale relative to remote | Not used as the edit surface for this split |

## Evidence Recording Rules

- Evidence collected from context-mode must be summarized into repo files before
  it becomes durable project evidence.
- GitNexus risk results belong in implementation or authorization reports, not
  only in chat memory.
- GitHub PR state must include PR number, branch, base, and checked timestamp.
- Generated artifact references must include `generated_at`, `git_head` when
  available, `current_head_checked_at_review`, and a stale policy.
- Graphiti entries should record accepted milestone summaries after the repo or
  GitHub artifact exists.
