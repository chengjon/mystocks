# Product Guidelines: MyStocks

## 1. Communication Style

*   **Modern and Accessible:** The language used throughout the platform should be clear, concise, and easy to understand for users of all experience levels. Avoid jargon where possible, and when it's necessary, provide clear explanations. The goal is to create a user-friendly and approachable experience.

## 2. Visual Identity & User Experience (UX)

*   **Data-Rich and Customizable:** The user interface should be designed to present extensive financial data in a clear and organized manner. Dashboards, charts, and data tables should be highly customizable to allow users to tailor the interface to their specific needs and workflows.

## 3. Interaction Design Principles

*   **Direct Manipulation:** Users should be able to directly interact with data elements and interface components. This includes features like drag-and-drop for customizing dashboards, resizing widgets, and directly manipulating chart elements.
*   **Feedback and Responsiveness:** The system must provide immediate and clear feedback for all user actions. This is especially critical for a real-time system, as it ensures users feel in control and understand the system's status. Actions like placing an order, updating a setting, or applying a filter should result in a clear and immediate response.
